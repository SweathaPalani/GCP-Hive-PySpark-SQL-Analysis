## 📖 Overview
This project focuses on **SQL-based big data analysis** using **Apache Hive and Apache Spark on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** along with **SQLite**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from a retail dataset by leveraging cloud computing and distributed data processing.

## 🔹 Technology Stack
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** → Infrastructure for running Apache Hive and PySpark.
- **Apache Hive (Running on GCP Dataproc)** → Distributed SQL engine for large-scale queries.
- **Apache Spark (Running on GCP Dataproc)** → Fast, distributed data processing for complex analytics.
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** → Cloud storage for structured and unstructured datasets.
- **SQLite (Local Processing)** → Lightweight SQL database for additional querying and analysis.

## 📊 Key Analysis Areas
Queries analyze:
- **Aisle trends** → Identify best-selling aisles based on order volume.
- **Customer behavior** → Understanding purchasing patterns and repeat orders.
- **Product recommendations** → Frequently bought together products for cross-selling.
- **Time-based order patterns** → Identifying peak ordering hours for different departments.

## 🛠 How This Data Helps Retailers
✔ **Optimized product placement** based on aisle performance.  
✔ **Better customer experience** with relevant bundle offers.  
✔ **Data-driven marketing campaigns** for retargeting customers.  
✔ **Efficient staff & inventory management** based on time-based order trends.
